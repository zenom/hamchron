1. Convert genserver to task? Periodic, not sure we really need to save it.
2. Store some basic params for the callsign etc., maybe that is all we use the db for?
  - Store just the last space weather.
3. Processor to handle XML for different things.
4. Gather grid square and callsign on signup, allow for editing.
5. Add QRZ api key to fetch
6. Store it with Task.Supervisor.async_nolink #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv40UpQH1yw&t=283s
7. Filter options to show only certain bands, modes.
8. Fix why map does not autoload after failure/restart service.

# can we use async_assigns to start, then set a timer for the task maybe?
